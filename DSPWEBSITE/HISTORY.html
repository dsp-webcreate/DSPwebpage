        <p><strong>In 1953</strong>, the Tabuena Family opened Pilar Institute as a branch of Bicol College, Daraga, Albay. But for some reasons, in 1968, the Tabuenas decided to sell the school. Rev. Fr. Vicente Romano, the Parish Priest of Pilar, consulted the bishop of Sorsogon. His proposal was approved, and he was tasked with negotiating with the owner and religious congregations.</p>

        <p>Mother Teresita Hacbang, O.P., then Prioress General of the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena, was offered the school’s administration. After evaluation and several conferences, the school was purchased, and the Dominican Sisters began operating it — becoming the first and only Catholic school in Pilar.</p>

        <p>The former “Pilar Institute” was renamed “Dominican School of Pilar Inc.” and officially recognized in 1971. The pioneering sisters were Sr. Norberta Orbita, OP (Superior), Sr. Violeta Estrada, OP (Principal), and Sr. Priscilla Faraon, OP (Treasurer). Despite limited facilities and funding, they worked diligently to grow the school.</p>

        <p><strong>In 1980</strong>, a new two-story building was built, housing offices, faculty rooms, a library, laboratory, and quarters. Due to financial constraints, it wasn't fully finished until 1988.</p>

        <p><strong>In 1987</strong>, Typhoon Sisang destroyed both buildings. Though the congregation considered closing the school, generous benefactors helped rebuild. By June 1988, two new buildings with seven classrooms were finished, and the third floor of an earlier building was added.</p>

        <p><strong>Today</strong>, the school continues to grow under the OP-Siena Schools Systems Development Program (OP-SSDP), promoting a Christian learning community inspired by Dominican values and the ideals of Mother Francisca del Espiritu Santo de Fuentes, the foundress.

         <p>After the administration of Sr. Ma. Violeta Franco, OP from 1970 to 1971, the following sister administrators served the institution; 
  
         <p> Sr. Ma. Salvacion Frias, OP	1971 – 1973
         <p> Sr. Ma. Elsa Jover, OP 		1973 – 1975
         <p> Sr. Ma. Violeta Estrada, OP 		1975 – 1977
         <p> Sr. Carmencita Aguarilles, OP 		1977– 1978
         <p>Sr. Ma. Marta Encinas, OP 		1978 – 1979
         <p> Sr. Ma. Carmencita Aguarilles, OP 		1979 – 1982
         <p>Sr. Ma. Violeta Estrada, OP	1982 – 1984
         <p>Sr. Arsenia Villegas, OP	1984 – 1985
         <p>Sr. Ma. Marcelina Gallano, OP	1985 – 1988
         <p>Sr. Arsenia Villegas, OP 		1988 – 1989
         <p>Sr. Florencia Cabanog, OP	1989 – 1993
          <p>Sr. Rita Santos, OP	May 1993- September 1994
          <p>Sr. Felicidad Lipio, OP	September 1994–March 1994
          <p>Sr. Ma. Concesa Pedrosa, OP	1994 – 1997
          <p>Sr. Trinidad Garcia, OP	1997 – 2000
          <p>Sr. Ceferina Alvarez, OP	2000 – 2001
          <p>Sr. Ma. Violeta Estrada	2001 – 2002
          <p>Sr. Lourdes Molina, OP	2002 – 2003
          <p>Sr. Paz Rapirap, OP 		2003 – 2004
          <p>Sr. Daisy Fornan, OP 		2004 – 2006
          <p>Sr Anna Rheza Valle, OP 		2006 – 2008
          <p>Sr. Paz Rapirap, OP 		2008 – 2011
          <p>Sr. Aileen Saligan, OP 		2011 – 2013
          <p>Sr. Wilma Bumangabang, OP	2013 – 2014

          <p>Sr. Enriqueta B. Arnaiz, OP	2024- Present

        <p>With the humblest beginnings, Dominican School of Pilar Inc. rose to its present stature and stands out as a Catholic Institution that provides Christian education to the youth of Pilar and the surrounding areas in Sorsogon. </p>
